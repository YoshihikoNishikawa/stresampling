# Example

We provide two Python codes to demonstrate the usage of the package:

- 2dTimeseries.py: This code generates a two-dimensional timeseries with autoregressive models and calculates the statistics of the covariance using the timeseries.

- 2dIsing.py: This code generates equilibrium configurations of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical temperature and calculates the 2nd-moment correlation length.
